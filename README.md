#### To use mongo change stream server to publish meteor data 

> #### Install instruction
```shell script
meteor add nilz:change-stream
```

> #### Usage instruction
```js
// simple usage to publish data with change stream without any query
// same as `SomeCollection.find() in meteor publish`
Meteor.publishChangeStream({
  name: 'get1',
  collection: House
})
```
For querying the data, here aggregation framework have been used
> For more details https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/#modify-change-stream-output
```js
// simple usage to publish data with change stream
Meteor.publishChangeStream({
  name: 'get1',
  collection: House,
  pipleline: [ // aggregation pipeline
        { $match: { 'fullDocument.username': 'alice' } }
  ]
})
```

# !important: add `fullDocument` before each fields in pipeline as example above

### Support only transformation, so no `$lookup` for now :(
```javascript
$addFields
$match
$project
$replaceRoot
$replaceWith (Available starting in MongoDB 4.2)
$redact
$set (Available starting in MongoDB 4.2)
$unset (Available starting in MongoDB 4.2)
```

> ### Reason: (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/)
Change streams allow applications to access real-time data changes without the complexity and risk of tailing the oplog. 
Applications can use change streams to subscribe to all data changes on a single collection, a database, or an entire deployment, and immediately react to them. Because change streams use the aggregation framework, applications can also filter for specific changes or transform the notifications at will.





> ### Need to implement:

- Resume a Change Stream | https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/#resume-a-change-stream
- Add tests.
- Option to rerun query on change stream event trigger. Might be able to implement rerun with proper aggregation pipeline
